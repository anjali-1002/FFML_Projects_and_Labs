        "This project aims to predict students' academic performance using machine learning algorithms. It leverages student-related features such as past grades, study time, family support, and more to predict the final grade (G3) and classify whether a student will pass or fail.\n",

        "- Predict final grade (G3) with high accuracy.\n",
        "- Classify student status: Pass (G3 >= 10) or Fail.\n",
        "- Identify key factors influencing performance.\n",
        "- Compare different machine learning models.\n",
        "- Provide actionable insights for educational interventions.\n",
